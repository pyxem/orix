Contributing
============

orix is a community maintained project. We welcome contributions in the form of bug
reports, feature requests, code, documentation, and more. These guidelines provide
resources on how best to contribute.

For new users, checking out the `GitHub guides <https://guides.github.com>`_ are
recommended.

Questions, comments, and feedback
=================================

Have any questions, comments, suggestions for improvements, or any other
inquiries regarding the project? Feel free to
`open an issue <https://github.com/pyxem/orix/issues>`_ or
`make a pull request <https://github.com/pyxem/orix/pulls>`_ in our GitHub repository.

Set up a development installation
=================================

You need a `fork
<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#about-forking>`_
of the `repository <https://github.com/pyxem/orix>`_ in order to make changes to orix.

Make a local copy of your forked repository and change directories::

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/orix.git
    cd orix

Set the ``upstream`` remote to the main orix repository::

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/pyxem/orix.git

We recommend installing in a `conda environment
<https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
with the `Miniconda distribution <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_::

    conda create --name orix
    conda activate orix

Then, install the required dependencies while making the development version available
globally (in the ``conda`` environment)::

    pip install --editable .[dev]

This installs all necessary development dependencies, including those for running tests
and building documentation.

Code style
==========

The code making up orix is formatted closely following the `Style Guide for Python Code
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ with `The Black Code style
<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html>`_. We use
`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ to run ``black`` automatically prior to each
local commit. Please install it in your environment::

    pre-commit install

Next time you commit some code, your code will be formatted inplace according
to the default black configuration.

Note that ``black`` won't format `docstrings
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_. We follow the `numpydoc
<https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard>`_
standard.

Comment lines should preferably be limited to 72 characters.

Package imports should be structured into three blocks with blank lines between them
(descending order): standard library (like ``os`` and ``typing``), third party packages
(like ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib``) and finally orix imports.

Make changes
============

Create a new feature branch::

    git checkout master -b your-awesome-feature-name

When you've made some changes you can view them with::

    git status

Add and commit your created, modified or deleted files::

    git add my-file-or-directory
    git commit -s -m "An explanatory commit message"

The ``-s`` makes sure that you sign your commit with your `GitHub-registered email
<https://github.com/settings/emails>`_ as the author. You can set this up following
`this GitHub guide
<https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address>`_.

Keep your branch up-to-date
===========================

Switch to the ``master`` branch::

    git checkout master

Fetch changes and update ``master``::

    git pull upstream master --tags

Update your feature branch::

    git checkout your-awesome-feature-name
    git merge master

Share your changes
==================

Update your remote branch::

    git push -u origin your-awesome-feature-name

You can then make a `pull request
<https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request>`_ to orix's
``master`` branch. Good job!

Build and write documentation
=============================

We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ for documenting functionality.
Install necessary dependencies to build the documentation::

    pip install --editable .[doc]

Then, build the documentation from the ``doc`` directory::

    cd doc
    make html

The documentation's HTML pages are built in the ``doc/build/html`` directory from files
in the `reStructuredText (reST)
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_
plaintext markup language. They should be accessible in the browser by typing
``file:///your-absolute/path/to/orix/doc/build/html/index.html`` in the address bar.

Tips for writing Jupyter Notebooks that are meant to be converted to reST text
files by `nbsphinx <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_:

- Notebooks (with the `.ipynb` file extension) are ignored by git (listed in the
  `.gitignore` file). The ``-f``
  `git flag <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt--f>`_ must be
  added to ``git add -f notebook.ipynb`` in order to update an existing notebook or add
  a new one. Notebooks are ignored by git in general to avoid non-documentation changes
  to notebooks, like cell IDs, being pushed unnecessarily.
- All notebooks should have a Markdown (MD) cell with this message at the top,
  "This notebook is part of the `orix` documentation https://orix.rtfd.io. Links to the
  documentation won't work from the notebook.", and have ``"nbsphinx": "hidden"`` in the
  cell metadata so that the message is not visible when displayed in the documentation.
- Use ``_ = ax[0].imshow(...)`` to disable Matplotlib output if a Matplotlib command is
  the last line in a cell.
- Refer to our API reference with this general MD
  ``[Vector3d.zvector()](reference.rst#orix.vector.Vector3d.zvector)``. Remember to add
  the parentheses ``()``.
- Reference external APIs via standard MD like
  ``[Lattice](https://www.diffpy.org/diffpy.structure/mod_lattice.html#diffpy.structure.lattice.Lattice)``.
- The Sphinx gallery thumbnail used for a notebook is set by adding the
  ``nbsphinx-thumbnail`` tag to a code cell with an image output. The notebook must be
  added to the gallery in the README.rst to be included in the documentation pages.
- The Furo Sphinx theme displays the documentation in a light or dark theme, depending
  on the browser/OS setting. It is important to make sure the documentation is readable
  with both themes. This means for example displaying all figures with a white
  background for axes labels and ticks and figure titles etc. to be readable.
- Whenever the documentation is built (locally or on Read the Docs' server), nbsphinx
  only runs the notebooks *without* cell output stored. It is recommended that notebooks
  are stored without cell output, so that functionality within them are run and tested
  to ensure continued compatibility with code changes. Cell output should be stored in
  notebooks which are too computationally intensive for Read the Docs' server, which has
  a limit of 15 minutes and 3 GB of memory per `build
  <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/builds.html>`_.

Deprecations
============

We attempt to adhere to semantic versioning as best we can with orix. This means that as
little, ideally no, functionality should break between minor releases. Deprecation
warnings are raised whenever possible and feasible for
functions/methods/properties/arguments, so that users get a heads-up one (minor) release
before something is removed or changes, with a possible alternative to be used.

The decorator should be placed right above the object signature to be deprecated, like
so::

    @deprecate(since=0.8, removal=0.9, alternative="bar")
    def foo(self, n):
        return n + 1

    @property
    @deprecate(since=0.9, removal=0.10, alternative="another", object_type="property")
    def this_property(self):
        return 2

Run and write tests
===================

All functionality in orix is tested via the `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`_
framework. The tests reside in a ``test`` directory within each module. Tests are short
methods that call functions in orix and compare resulting output values with known
answers. Install necessary dependencies to run the tests::

   $ pip install --editable .[tests]

Some useful `fixtures <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html>`_ are available
in the ``conftest.py`` file.

To run the tests::

   $ pytest --cov --pyargs orix

The ``--cov`` flag makes `coverage.py <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
print a nice report in the terminal. For an even nicer presentation, you can use
``coverage.py`` directly::

   $ coverage html

Then, you can open the created ``htmlcov/index.html`` in the browser and inspect the
coverage in more detail.

Continuous integration (CI)
===========================

We use `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/pyxem/orix/actions>`_ to ensure that
orix can be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux (Ubuntu). After a successful
installation, the CI server runs the tests. After the tests return no errors, code
coverage is reported to `Coveralls
<https://coveralls.io/github/pyxem/orix?branch=master>`_.
