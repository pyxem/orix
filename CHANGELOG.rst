Unreleased
==========

Added
-----
- CrystalMap.empty() class method to create empty map of a given shape with identity
  rotations.
- CrystalMap.plot() method for easy plotting of phases, properties etc.
- Python 3.9 support.
- Miller class, inherinting functionality from the Vector3d class, to handle operations
  with direct lattice vectors (uvw/UVTW) and reciprocal lattice vectors (hkl/hkil).
- Warning when trying to create rotations from large Euler angles
- Passing symmetry when initializing an Orientation.
- Vector3d.scatter() and Vector3d.draw_circle() methods to show unit vectors and
  great/small circles in stereographic projection
- User guide with Jupyter notebooks as part of the Read the Docs documentation
- Stereographic projection using Matplotlib's projections framework for plotting
  vectors, great/small circles, and symmetry elements
- orix.projections module for projecting vectors to various coordinates, including
  stereographic coordinates
- .ang file writer for CrystalMap objects (via orix.io.save())
- Overloaded division for Vector3d (left hand side) by numbers and suitably shaped
  array-like objects

Changed
-------
- Names of spherical coordinates for the Vector3d class, "phi" to "azimuth", "theta" to
  "polar", and "r" to "radial". Similar changes to to/from_polar parameter names.
- CrystalMap.get_map_data() tries to respect input data type, other minor improvements
- Continuous integration migrated from Travis CI to GitHub Actions

Fixed
-----
- Symmetry is preserved when creating a misorientation from orientations or when
  inverting orientations
- Reading of properties (scores etc.) from EMsoft h5ebsd files with certain map shapes
- Reading of crystal symmetry from EMsoft h5ebsd dot product files in CrystalMap plugin

2020-11-03 - version 0.5.1
==========================

Added
-----
- This project now keeps a Changelog
- Testing for Py3.8 on OSX

Fixed
-----
- CrystalMap properties allow arrays with number of dimensions greater than 2
- .ang file reader now recognises phase IDs defined in the header
- EMsoft file reader reads unrefined Euler angles correctly
